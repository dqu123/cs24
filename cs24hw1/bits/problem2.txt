The expression n = n & (n - 1) unsets the rightmost set bit of n.
It works because subtracting 1 requires a carry if there
is a string of 0s at the end of number. For example
111000 - 1 = 110111. Here, all the carried bits get
flipped, so they are unset when n is bitwise "and"-ed with (n - 1).
The rightmost set bit is always changed when you subtract 1,
and no bits to the left of that are affected. This expression
lets us count bits by iterating this process until the number is
0, and counting how many iterations were necessary since
each iteration removes exactly one bit.
